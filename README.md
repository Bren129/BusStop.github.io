# MIT Project: MIT to Harvard

MIT Web Development Week 9 Project.

Here in Week 9 we developed a real time simulation of bus stop transfers from campus to campus (MIT to Harvard).




## How to run:

- Load the HTML file into a compatible browser.
- Click "Show Stops Between MIT and Harvard". 
- Doing this will activate the real time marker, and show you all stops along the way. 


    
## Roadmap for future improvements:

- Improve accuracy of marker display. 

- Optimize simulation of marker movement. 

- Add more detail of street names.

- Add numbers for bus stops on map.
